# orchard

`orchard` is a wrapper for [`lemonbar`](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) and `admiral` which allows you to create completely customised and multithreaded instances of status bars, whose behaviours can be changed simply by clicking. All desired behaviour and style options are specified from one TOML configuration file.
